Lists are sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation. As compared to the vector, the list has slow traversal, but once a position has been found, insertion and deletion are quick (constant time). Normally, when we say a List, we talk about a doubly linked list. For implementing a singly linked list, we use a forward_list.
std::list is the class of the List container. It is the part of C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and is defined inside <list> header file.


Syntax :  std::list <data-type> name_of_list;


Some Basic Operations on std::list
1. front() –> Returns the value of the first element in the list.
2. back() –> Returns the value of the last element in the list.
3. push_front() –> Adds a new element ‘g’ at the beginning of the list.
4. push_back() –> Adds a new element ‘g’ at the end of the list.
5. pop_front() –> Removes the first element of the list, and reduces the size of the list by 1.
6. pop_back() –> Removes the last element of the list, and reduces the size of the list by 1.
7. insert() –> Inserts new elements in the list before the element at a specified position.
8. size() –> Returns the number of elements in the list.
9. begin() –> begin() function returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the list.
10.end() –> end() function returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical last element which follows the last element.
